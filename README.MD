# Problem Statement

Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes etc. are often accompanied by interruption in routine activity.These interruptions create a significant amount of incovenience for society,leading to both monetary loss and loss of life.
India has lost 79.5 billion USD in the last 20 years and 43.4% of it was accounted for by floods. Solutions to disaster management can help maintain the natural direction of a nation's economy. New challenges created by these disaster scenarios demand solutions tailored to them. Principal challenges faced by individuals in disaster areas include - lack of mobility, inability to communicate and lack of access to essential resources and incoherent rescue efforts.

Since disaster often alter urban and rural landscapes, routes suggested by existing routing applications may not be feasable to traverse in a disaster scenario. Also, good samaritans with access to vital resources - food, water, clothes, shelter etc. can provide necessary help to disaster victims. However, there exists a communication gap between them. The objective of our project is to tackle the mentioned issues to help support individuals in these disaster scenarios.

# Proposed Solution

Our proposed solution is deployed in the form of a mobile application. 

Dependencies of this application :- 

+ Sufficiently Charged Mobile Phone
+ Wi-Fi Direct Capability  
+ Internet Connection (non essential)

We are essentially building a routing application for disaster scenarios. For each route suggested to the user we include timestamps indicating the last time the particular route was traversed. This allows users to guage the relevancy of the route suggested in a disaster scenario thus, allowing them to make more informed decisions.

Another utility of the application is the addition of resource points. Good samaritans with access to resources may mark their locations on the map indicating access to critical resources such as - food, water, clothes, shelter etc. This enables victims to identify nearby locations where they can gain access to critical resources ensuring their sustainence during disasters.

In scenarios wherein internet capability is unavailable, we make use of Wi-Fi Direct technology enabling users to share critical location data with each other thereby allowing access to information collected by other users. Another functionality we aim to provide with the use of this technology is a Wi-Fi Direct based chat facility allowing users to communicate with each other within closed spaces wherein mobility is difficult - earthquakes in buildings, resedential fire scenarios. This reduces dependency on the internet.

We also plan to include two modes of operation - High Power, Low Power - considering mobile phone battery is a critical resource during such disaster scenarios and needs to be preserved as much as possible.

# Technologies Used

Currently we have identified use of the following technologies in the development of our project :-

+ Xamarin - Cross-Platform Mobile Application Development
+ Google Maps API
+ .NET MVC
+ jQuery
+ Microsoft Azure
