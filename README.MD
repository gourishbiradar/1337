Team Name: 1337

Idea:

One of the major challenges that people stuck in disasters is the challenge of mobility.
Our idea is to help people get to safe zones and point out the location of sources of food,water,medicines and any rescue missions that are going on in the affected area.

Further we would also let the application have multiple modes of usage depending upon the device battery level and distance from a safe zone.
